# vdgm_assignment_5
lowkey chull
for this assignment i created a simple platformer game with spikes as obstacles and some floating rocks as platforms. for fun a added music and made the player bouncy.
i edited the speed of the player to make him faster and make the jumping speed slightly slower. 
some challanges i had to overcome was to fix the camera because it just started showing a solid color instead of my game. also i tried to add a code to make the amera follow the player but i couldnt get that to work.
i solved the first problem by adjusting the layers for the camera and editing some of the codes i had alterred. i solved the seond problem by giving up on the camera follow, but then i relised that it wasnt working because my player wasnt tagged
